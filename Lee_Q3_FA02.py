1. Scenario: Daily step count with my BFFs for 5 days

2.
Rows represent my friends
Columns represents the days from monday to friday

3. steps = [
    [5000, 6200, 7000, 6500, 7200],  
    [4500, 5800, 6000, 6100, 6900],  
    [7000, 7500, 8000, 7800, 8200]   
]
print(steps[1][2])
steps[0][0] = 5300


average_friend3 = sum(steps[2]) / len(steps[2])
print(average_friend3)

# Reflection:
I chose daily health since I wanted to include my friends inside my code. However, I didn't choose that just because of my friends, but also because for health and fitness. This will help us track our steps, which we can use to motivate ourselves to keep pushing forward.
